# Educational Institution Network Project

## Overview

This project, implemented in the field of Networking, is a comprehensive network design and development initiative for an educational institution comprising two branches: the main branch located in Amman and a secondary branch situated in the city of Karak, approximately 150 kilometers away.

## Conclusion

This outreach project has successfully addressed the complex requirements of an educational institution spanning multiple fields. I demonstrate this with my proficiency as a developer in network design, topology selection, hardware and software considerations, server selection, implementation, and rigorous testing.

Furthermore, the project highlighted the ability to recommend enhancements for networked systems and design maintenance schedules to support ongoing system stability. The application of critical reflection and justification of conclusions further underscored the comprehensive understanding and expertise demonstrated throughout the project.

The successful completion of this project, in accordance with the objectives of the Networking course, marks a significant achievement in the field of networking and network design.
